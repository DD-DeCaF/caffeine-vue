              Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not
              knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone
              under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are
              aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data, please
              contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal
              Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of
              parental consent, We take steps to remove that information from
              Our servers.

              We also may limit how We collect, use, and store some of the
              information of Users between 13 and 18 years old. In some cases,
              this means We will be unable to provide certain functionality of
              the Service to these users.

              If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your
              information and Your country requires consent from a parent, We
              may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that
              information.
